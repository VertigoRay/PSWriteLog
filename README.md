![PSWriteLog](https://tinyurl.com/59jee5tf) is a tool to standardize logging without the need to use new function calls in your PowerShell scripts.
Just configure the log location (or don't) and start logging with your standard `Write` functions.

# Quick Start

Before you do anything, [install *PSWriteLog*](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWriteLog).
Create a new script, mine will be called `foo.ps1` and will contain the following lines:

```powershell
#Requires -Modules PSWriteLog
Write-Host 'Hello World!'
```

**I love how clean and simple that is!**
However, [the `#Requires` statement will terminate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_requires?view=powershell-5.1#-modules-module-name--hashtable) if you don't have *PSWriteLog* installed.
Since we're not introducing any new functions, *PSWriteLog* shouldn't be required to *just run the script*.
For more explanation about his example, [check out the wiki](/VertigoRay/PSWriteLog/wiki/Examples#quick-start-with-requires)!

To ensure there are no errors if you share your script with someone that doesn't have *PSWriteLog* installed, [you will want to use `Import-Module`](/VertigoRay/PSWriteLog/wiki/Examples#quick-start-w-import-module).

# Description

PSWriteLog has a private function called `Write-Log` that does all the logging for you.
It's a private function because we don't want you to use it.
Instead, we've created [proxy functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.proxycommand?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0) for the `Write-*` functions so you don't have to learn to use a new function.
These proxy functions keep the original functionality of the function intact, while also sending the outputted message to the `Write-Log` function.
By default, `Write-Log` will write messages to a log file in [CMTrace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/support/cmtrace) compatible format, but Legacy (plain-text) file format is also available.
To configure *PSWriteLog*, what you need to do is change the default actions of the `Write-Log` parameters.
You can specify default parameters using environment variables.
Here's an example of specifying the Log file path and log type globally:

```powershell
$env:PSWriteLogFilePath = "${env:SystemRoot}\Logs\MyApp.log"
$env:PSWriteLogType = 'Legacy'
```

# Notes

The rest of this stuff is really beyond the scope of *PSWriteLog*, but I hope it's useful information ...

## Bypassing Write-Log

There may be instances when you are using *PSWriteLog* that you want to output to the screen, but not save the output to the log.
Maybe you have sensitive data (e.g.: passwords, auth tokens, etc.) that you don't want saved to a log file.
In those cases, you can bypass *PSWriteLog*'s logging functionality, by telling PowerShell to use the original Microsoft function using its full path.
Here's how you get the full path to `Write-Host`:

```powershell
Get-Command Write-Host
```

That'll give you the source and other information:

> CommandType | Name | Version | Source
> ----------- | ---- | ------- | ------
> Cmdlet | Write-Host | 3.1.0.0 | Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility

You can then call the function and provide the source path as well:

```powershell
Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Host "Password: $password"
```

## Debug with Write-Information

I like to use `Write-Information` to debug because I send the messages to a variable and filter them later.
Instead of scrolling through a ton of `Verbose` or `Debug` output, I can just filter down to the messages that came tagged the way I was expecting.
Here's some sample code for you to play with and see what I'm talking about:

```powershell
function foo {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    Param()
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Information 'Test 1'
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Information "[foo] Processor: $env:PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER" -Tags 'foo','Test'
    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\Write-Information 'Test 2'
}
foo -InformationVariable bar
$bar | ?{ $_.Tags -eq 'foo' }
```

If you aren't near a PowerShell terminal, here's a quick demo:

![Write-Information Tag Filtering](https://i.imgur.com/u9WBQQG.gif)

## Debug PSWriteLog (or Your Application)

In *PSWriteLog* every `Write-Information` that I use, [bypasses the the log](#bypassing-write-log).
This means that my `Write-Information` calls *should* never end up in your log file.
They also have two tags:

- `VertigoRay\PSWriteLog`
- The Function Name (e.g.: `Write-Log`)

For me, when I'm working on *PSWriteLog* and I want to see just those messages, I'll do something like this:

```powershell
$InformationPreference = 'Continue'
$PSDefaultParameterValues.Set_Item('Write-Log:InformationVariable', 'foo')

Write-Host 'Testing a thing' -InformationVariable 'foo'
$foo | ?{ $_.Tags -eq 'Write-Log' }
```

With that I'll see just want I want to see.
You can use the same ideas in your scripts by always tagging your calls to `Write-Information` so that when you want to redirect them to a variable for easy filtering, you can.

Cheers! üçª
